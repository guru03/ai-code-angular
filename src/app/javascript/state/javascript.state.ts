Some common lifecycle hooks include ngOnInit (called after the component is initialized), ngOnChanges (called when input properties change), ngOnDestroy (called just before the component is destroyed), and ngAfterViewInit (called after the component's view has been fully initialized). These hooks provide opportunities to perform initialization, cleanup, or respond to changes in the component's state."

Closures are commonly used for data privacy and creating functions with persistent state."

For example, 5 == '5' would return true because the string '5' is coerced to the number 5. On the other hand, === is the strict equality operator that does not perform type coercion and requires both the value and type to be the same for it to return true. So, 5 === '5' would return false because they are of different types."
